description: Understanding we are all sinners, and what sin is
---

### Introduce yourself, and offer a tract to the person (e.g. Invite to local IFB church)
### Proceed then in asking 'More importantly than giving you this tract.. God forbid; if you were to die today, do you know 100% for sure that you would go to heaven?'
### Await for response and then kindly and boldly ask the person something along the lines of-'If you have a moment, I can show you from the Word of God that when you die you're 100% on your way to heaven.'

# Begin Gospel Presentation
## **1** In 1 John 5:13, God tells us: *These things have I written unto you that believe on the name of the Son of God; that ye may know that ye have eternal life, and that ye may believe on the name of the Son of God.*
### Explanation: God is letting us know that we can be 100% sure that we are going to heaven.

## **2** Next, explain Romans 3:23: *For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;* and Romans 3:10: *As it is written, There is none righteous, no, not one:*
### Explanation: God is explaining that we are all sinners and we have all fallen short of His glory.

## **3** 1 John 3:4: *Whosoever committeth sin transgresseth also the law: for sin is the transgression of the law.*
### Explanation: Here, we learn that sin is the transgression of God's law.

## **4** Romans 6:23 *For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.*
### Explanation: Focus on the 1st part of that scripture-'For the wages of sin is death'- When I go to work, I earn a wage, but when I sin; what I earn is death. When the Bible talks about death, we learn that there's more than just a first death (the physical death), but there is also a second death (spiritual death).
