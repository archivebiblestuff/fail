## Salvation is not based on how good you are.

```Romans 3:23 For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;```
```Romans 3:10 As it is written, There is none righteous, no, not one```

No one is perfect, no one is good enough, we all come short. If getting into heaven was based on how perfect we are, none of us would be going.


### 1. Admit You Are A Sinner

```Revelation 21:8 But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.```

Everyone has lied, so we’ve all sinned and we all deserve hell.

## 2. Realize The Penalty For Sin

But the Bible says that Christ died for us even though we are sinners.

```Romans 5:8 8 But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.```

And so Jesus Christ because he loves us came to this earth, the Bible says he was God manifested in human flesh. God took on human form, he lived a sinless life, he did not commit any sin, and of course, they beat him, spit on him, and nailed Him to the cross.

```1 Timothy 3:16 And without controversy great is the mystery of godliness: God was manifest in the flesh, justified in the Spirit, seen of angels, preached unto the Gentiles, believed on in the world, received up into glory.```

The Bible says when he was on that cross, He will bear our sins in His own body on the tree. So every sin you’ve ever done and I’ve ever done is as if Jesus had done it. 

```1 Peter 2:24 Who his own self bare our sins in his own body on the tree, that we, being dead to sins, should live unto righteousness: by whose stripes ye were healed.```

He was being punished for our sins and then, of course, they took his body when he died and buried it in the tomb and his soul went down to hell for 3 days and 3 nights. 

```Acts 2:31 He seeing this before spake of the resurrection of Christ, that his soul was not left in hell, neither his flesh did see corruption.```

3 days later he rose again from the dead, he showed unto the disciples the holes in his hands and the Bible is really clear that Jesus did die for everybody. 

```1 John 2:2 And he is the propitiation for our sins: and not for ours only, but also for the sins of the whole world.```

But there’s something we must do to be saved (```Acts 16:30-31 And brought them out, and said, Sirs, what must I do to be saved? And they said, Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved, and thy house.```) and that’s it. He didn’t say join a church and be saved nor get baptized, live a good life, nor repent of all your sins and you’ll be saved. No, he said, “believe.”

## 3. Believe That Jesus Died, Was Buried, And Rose Again For You

The most famous verse in the whole Bible (```John 3:16 For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.```) will tell you that by believing in Christ you will have everlasting life. Keep in mind that everlasting means forever. John 10:28 says that no man can pluck you out of your eternal life.

```John 10:28 And I give unto them eternal life; and they shall never perish, neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand.```

 John 6:47 and 11:26 tell you that whoever believes in Christ shall have everlasting life and never perish.
 
 ```John 6:47 Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that believeth on me hath everlasting life.```

```John 11:26 And whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die. Believest thou this?```
