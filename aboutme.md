You might've noticed the purple-scarlet background on top.

Why Scarlet? Scarlet represents the blood of Jesus who died on the cross for our sins. 

Why Purple? Purple represents Royalty, royalty because I am a son of the King, just like you! (John 1:12 states that to all those who received Jesus, to those who believed on His name, He gave them the right to be called sons of God.)
