## Admit you are a sinner
### For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God (Romans 3:23)
## Realize the penalty for sin
### For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord (Romans 6:23)
## Believe that Jesus died, was buried, and rose again for you
### For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life. (John 3:16)
## Trust Christ ALONE as your saviour
### For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: Not of works, lest any man should boast (Ephesians 2:8-9)
