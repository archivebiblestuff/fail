* If you are going door to door, start with a friendly knock. 
* Say that you are a Christian/Denomination right away (eg Baptist) so they don't mistake you for a Jehovah's witness. 
* Say that you are there to invite people to Church
* Cut to the chase don't waste people's time: let them know who you are and why you are there
* Ask questions but don't interrogate people
