* If you are going door to door, start with a friendly knock. 
* Say that you are a Christian/Denomination right away (eg Baptist) so they don't mistake you for a Jehovah's witness. 
* Say that you are there to invite people to Church
* Cut to the chase don't waste people's time: let them know who you are and why you are there
* Ask questions but don't interrogate people

### Figure out their beliefs first:
* Are you a Christian? A Lot of people will give you a positive answer
* Do you go to church anywhere?

**If they say yes to the above**, ask them if they were to die today, would they go to Heaven? If they __don't__ say “yes for sure” and have doubt, then present the gospel. _“Well, the Bible says we can know for sure, can i show you where?”_
