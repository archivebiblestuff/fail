## Explaning the Gospel 
*Matthew 4:19 - And he saith unto them, Follow me, and I will make you fishers of men.*

#### You've started the conversation, now your goals are:
1. Use the Bible (KJV)
    _Romans 10:17 - So then faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of God_
2. Make the Bible easy to understand - teach people. 
* Don't jump around the below points and make sure it flows. The goal is to be easily understood. 
* Time? As much as necessary but not too much time or you may lose people's interest. Typically takes 10-15 minutes. It may take longer sometimes, but only if you are making progress e.g they are receptive. 

#### First Steps:
* You are a sinner
* You deserve to go to hell

What's the purpose of being saved, if you don't know what you are being saved from?

Show them they are a sinner. 
* _Romans 3:23 - For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;_
       
Q. What is sin?
* _1 John 3:4 Whosoever committeth sin transgresseth also the law: for sin is the transgression of the law._

There is a punishment for that:
* _Romans 6:23 - For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord._

Physical death is not the end.. After that there is Heaven and Hell. Hell is known as the second death. (Can skip if they understand Heaven/Hell)
* _Revelation 20:14-15 And death and hell were cast into the lake of fire. This is the second death. And whosoever was not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire._

There is a list of people that the Bible tells us are going there. 
* _Revelation 21:8 But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death._

Well we've all lied before. 

Q. What if they say, I'm not a “liar” but I've told some lies.. 
  * **A.** Revelation 21:27 _And there shall in no wise enter into it any thing that defileth, neither whatsoever worketh abomination, or maketh a lie: but they which are written in the Lamb's book of life._
  * **B.** OR ask this Question. How many people do you have to murder to be a murderer?
