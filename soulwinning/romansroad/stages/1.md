## Understanding we are all sinners and what sin is:
Introduce yourself and offer a tract to the person (e.g. Invite to local IFB church)

Proceed then in asking ‘More importantly in giving you this tract… God forbid; if you were to die do you know 100% for sure that you would go to heaven?’

Await for response and then kindly and boldly ask the person something along the lines of – ‘If you have moment; I can show you from the word of God how you can know for sure that when you die you’re 100% on your way to Heaven.’
